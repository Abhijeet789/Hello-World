##Hi all,

I am Ian, from Malaysia and also working here. I'm still trying to develop and learn more in depth in software engineering. Currently, I'm doing web application and I am a full stack developer. 
My main programming language will be **Php** with **JS**, **CSS**, **HTML**, **SQL** as sides. 

I am looking toward developing myself more in AI, machine learning in **Python**. Have been planning to free up some time to commit into open source contribution. Still working on it. 

Glad to meet yall contributors. Peace.
