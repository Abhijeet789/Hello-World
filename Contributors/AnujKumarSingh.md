HI!! Everyone, I am Anuj Kumar Singh. I am an undergraduate student, studying at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.

I am interested in algorithmic coding. I have also tried my hands in Android App Development, and LINUX.

Hoping this first contribution wil give me an opportunity to explore more about Open Source. Looking Forward to a great learning experience.
