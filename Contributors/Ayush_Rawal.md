Hi I'm Ayush Rawal from Jaipur, India. I'm studying Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information technology Kota. I'm a fullstack web developer (MERN and MEAN stack) with a love for all things computers. When I'm not infront of my laptop I'm either hanging out with my friends or out exploring. Feel free to hit me up for a quick chat on [my github profile](https://github.com/Ayush-Rawal)
