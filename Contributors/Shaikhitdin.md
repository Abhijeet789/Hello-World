Hey everyone, my name is Shaikhitdin currently studying in sophomore year at UNIST, South Korea.

I decided to get that Hacktoberfest t-shirt right away, so here am I :)

Have been doing some competitive programming before, believe that I can master ML in near future.


Really liked your project guides, hope you will be doing great!
